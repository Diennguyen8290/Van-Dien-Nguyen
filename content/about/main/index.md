  I was born and raised in a small rice-farming village in central Vietnam, where I was lucky enough to have a childhood that there was nothing to ask for more.
  
  I graduated from Vietnam Military Medical University, Hanoi, Vietnam, where I did my general practice (2008-2015) and resident physician (2015-2018) training. Before joining Cardiff University in January 2020, I worked as a clinician at 103 Military Hospital, Hanoi.
  
  Currently, I'm a PhD student at School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom, where I’m juggling between hepatology, immunology and bioinformatics. I have a great interest in hepatology, and lately, bioinformatics. My focus is to leverage bulk sequencing (RNA requencing and microarray), single cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to better understand liver diseases.
  
  In my free time, I read, write (mostly poem), and travel whenever possible. I also love to meet and talk to new people too. I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
